Developer Student Clubs is a University Program kickstarted by Google Developers to train thousands of student developers globally and work with their communities to solve real-life problems.The Developer Student Clubs (DSC) program is a grassroots channel through which the members of the community provide development skills for students, towards employability. In addition to workshops, DSCs also provide an opportunity for students to apply their newly gained skills to develop solutions for local organizations, and then provide visibility via showcases.

## Description of program offering

### Workshops

* DSCs organize and facilitate workshops on university campuses to provide students with technical development skills.

### Solution development activities
* Students get an opportunity to apply their skills for a live problem sourced from the local community (sourced by the DSC community). In addition to development skills, the students gain problem solving skills as they understand more about the problem and are developing a solution using technology, along with communication skills as they learn how to ask questions to better understand the problem.

### Showcases
* Students will present the solutions in campus and city-level showcases, thus gaining visibility and inspiring more students to learn and apply development skills.

### Stories
* The DSC Leads are empowered to identify and share success stories within the campuses and at a local community level, thus inspiring more students to learn and apply development skills.
* Some of the stories are shared at regional and global levels.

### Conferences and other learning and development (L&D) opportunities
* The DSC Leads might have opportunities to attend conferences, workshops and other L&D opportunities. They will be supported with invites, passes, travel grants and mentoring opportunities.
